# GeoKinematics-3D

Browser-based software for rock-slope kinematic analysis, combining geological geometry, stereonet mathematics, 3D visualization, and Rust/WASM computation.

> **Status:** Phase 1C complete · Phase 1D in progress

## Current state

The project is currently focused on building and testing the mathematical and software foundations required for kinematic analysis.

Implemented so far:

- East-North-Up (ENU) coordinate convention
- Geological line and plane orientations
- 3D vector operations
- Plane geometry and normal handling
- Plane intersection calculations
- Wulff lower-hemisphere equal-angle projection
- Lineation and plane-pole projection
- Plane great-circle generation
- Rust/WASM computation boundary
- React/SVG stereonet visualization foundation

Higher-level kinematic analysis is not implemented yet.

## Scientific conventions

### Coordinate system

GeoKinematics-3D uses a right-handed East-North-Up coordinate system:

```text
+X = East
+Y = North
+Z = Up
```

Azimuths are measured clockwise from North.

### Geological orientations

Line orientations use:

```text
trend + plunge
```

Plane orientations use:

```text
dip direction + dip
```

Angles are represented explicitly as degrees or radians depending on the API.

### Numerical tolerance

Core geometric operations use:

```text
CANONICAL_EPSILON = 1e-12
```

This is used for operations such as zero-vector detection, normal canonicalization, parallelism, orthogonality, and floating-point boundary checks.

---

## Stereonet mathematics

Phase 1C implements a lower-hemisphere equal-angle stereographic projection (Wulff net).

The geometry package currently provides:

- Line orientation normalization
- Line orientation ↔ Cartesian vector conversion
- Wulff projection
- Wulff inverse projection
- Plane-pole projection
- Plane great-circle generation

Projected points use normalized stereonet coordinates:

```text
x ∈ [-1, 1]
y ∈ [-1, 1]
```

The UI layer maps these normalized coordinates to SVG coordinates. Projection mathematics remains in the geometry package and is not duplicated in the visualization layer.

### Great circles

Great circles are generated from the strike and down-dip basis vectors of a plane.

For a plane basis `S` and `D`:

```text
V(θ) = cos(θ)S + sin(θ)D
```

The resulting vectors are restricted to the lower hemisphere and projected onto the Wulff net.

Horizontal, dipping, and vertical planes are handled separately where required by the geometry.

The stereonet conventions are documented in:

```text
docs/decisions/ADR-008-stereonet-projection.md
```

## Architecture

The repository is organized as a pnpm workspace with separate application, domain, geometry, UI, and Rust packages.

```text
GeoKinematics-3D/
│
├── apps/
│   └── web/                  # Next.js application
│
├── packages/
│   ├── domain/               # Shared domain types
│   ├── geometry/             # Vector, plane, stereonet mathematics
│   └── ui/                   # React visualization components
│
├── crates/
│   └── geokinematics-core/   # Rust/WASM computation
│
└── docs/
    └── decisions/            # Architecture Decision Records
```

The dependency direction is kept deliberately simple:

```text
web
 │
 ├── ui
 │
 ├── domain
 │
 └── geometry
       │
       └── domain

Rust/WASM
   │
   └── computational boundary
```

Scientific packages do not depend on React or browser APIs.

The web application is responsible for application wiring, while the geometry package contains the TypeScript-side scientific mathematics and the Rust crate provides the foundation for performance-sensitive computation.

See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full package and boundary definitions.

## Stereonet visualization

Phase 1D introduces the first reusable UI representation of the stereonet.

The component is based on SVG and currently supports:

- Stereonet boundary
- Cardinal labels
- Grid markers
- Lineations
- Plane poles
- Great circles
- Configurable grid visibility
- Configurable label visibility
- Configurable SVG size

The component accepts already-projected stereonet coordinates and performs only the final display transform:

```text
svgX = center + stereonetX × radius
svgY = center - stereonetY × radius
```

This keeps scientific calculations outside the presentation layer.

---

## Testing

The project uses automated checks across the TypeScript, React, Rust, and browser layers.

Current checks include:

- Vitest unit tests
- React Testing Library
- TypeScript type checking
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Next.js build
- Playwright E2E tests
- Rust tests
- Rust formatting
- Rust linting
- WASM builds

Run the complete verification pipeline with:

```bash
pnpm verify
```

Package-level tests can be run independently:

```bash
pnpm test
```

For the UI package:

```bash
pnpm --filter @geokinematics/ui test
```

The stereonet geometry tests cover projection, inverse projection, poles, great circles, orientation conversion, and boundary cases.

## Development approach

The project is being developed from the underlying geometry upward.

```text
Coordinate conventions
        ↓
Orientations
        ↓
Vectors and planes
        ↓
Stereonet mathematics
        ↓
Visualization
        ↓
Kinematic analysis
        ↓
3D geological workspace
        ↓
Engineering analysis
```

Each layer is tested before higher-level functionality is built on top of it.

This is particularly important for the geometry and numerical code, where small convention differences can propagate into incorrect engineering results.

## Project status

GeoKinematics-3D is under active development.

The current release contains the project's geometry and stereonet foundations. It is **not yet a complete rock-slope analysis application** and should not be used as a production geotechnical analysis tool.
